Online Shopping App To Buy Books and Electronics
We are planning to make an online shopping application to sell books and electronic products. Four types of products will be sold and we will use object oriented programming during the creation of the products. The products will be generalized from photos, names and prices stored in the database and presented to the user interface. For now, we are considering offering the products to the customers in two forms: "Top sellers" and "New additions". Customers will be able to add the products they like to their basket and we will use a separate form for the "basket". We will get the name, surname and address information from the customer who wants to buy the products in the basket and save them in the database. Afterwards, the customer will be able to complete the order by choosing a payment method. We thought that if the payment method is paid by credit card, time restrictions can be imposed by using Timer.
